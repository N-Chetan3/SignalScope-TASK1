# SignalScope-TASK1

## Task Summary

### ✅ Part 1: 1D Convolution Methods Comparison
- Compared built-in MATLAB functions: `conv`, `filter`, `convn/conv2`.
- Implemented using simple signals and impulse responses.
- Plotted and analyzed the differences in behavior, syntax, and results.

### ✅ Part 2: Real-World Audio Filtering using 1D Convolution
- Gaussian noise added to real-world noisy audio.
- Applied **Moving Average Filter** and **Low-Pass FIR Filter**.
- Evaluated filtering effects via waveform plots and listening.
- PSNR and MSE calculated to measure filtering performance.

### ✅ Part 3: 2D Image Filtering using Convolution
- Gaussian noise added to a clean color image.
- Created and applied **Gaussian filter kernel** using `conv2`.
- Displayed original, noisy, and filtered images.
- Computed **MSE** and **PSNR** for performance evaluation.

## Files Included
- **MATLAB Codes**
- **Plots**
- **Report**


## Evaluation Metrics (For 2D Image Filtering)
